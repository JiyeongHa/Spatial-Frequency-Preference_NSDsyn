    "## 1. Make a .csv file that contains stimuli information\n",
    "I first created a dataframe that contains all stimuli information in order of the image index in the NSD synthetic experimental design.\n",
    "As with the experiment by Broderick et al (2022), the experiment contains 4 different stimulus types: pinwheel, forward spiral, annulus, and reverse spiral. Adding to that, there was intermediate stimulus type - which has the same frequency across the visual field but ___. I first named them all differently (e.g. intermediate 1, intermediate 2, ..), but they all can be defined as just 'intermediate' because ___.\n",
    "Except for intermediate stimuli, all stimulus types had 6 different frequency levels and 4 different phase shifts. The order of stimulus class in the experimental design was pinwheel-forward spiral-annulus-reverse spiral. For each stimulus type, spiral images come in a group of 4, as the only difference in each group of 4 is just a phase shift. Image index and frequency level was organized in an ascending manner. For example, 4 pinwheel images with frequency level 1 is followed by 4 pinwheel images with frequency level 2, and then by the same stimulus class with frequency level 3.\n",
    "On the other hand, intermediate stimuli only had one frequency level. The total number of images were 112 (4 regular stim class * 4 phase * 6 frequency + 4 intermediate class * 4 phase * 1 frequency)."

    "4. w_r: This is a radial frequency that specifies the number of radians per unit increase in ln(r).\n",
    "5. w_a: This is an angular frequency specifying the number of grating cycles per revolution around the image.\n",
    "6. frequency level: This indicates a local frequency level. Regular stimulus classes have 6 different levels (0-6)\n",
